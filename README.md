## üîß How It Works

### Architecture

The extension consists of three main components:

1. **Background Script** (`background.js`)
   - Manages professor data fetching and caching
   - Handles communication with content scripts
   - Implements smart name matching algorithms

2. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Injects rating UI into the Schedule Builder
   - Monitors DOM changes for dynamic content
   - Handles iframe injection for embedded content

3. **Manifest** (`manifest.json`)
   - Defines extension permissions and structure
   - Configures content script injection rules

### Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**: Extension fetches professor data from a GitHub repository
2. **Caching**: Data is cached locally for offline use and performance
3. **Name Matching**: Advanced algorithms match professor names across different formats
4. **UI Injection**: Ratings are injected into the Schedule Builder interface
5. **User Interaction**: Clicking ratings opens professor profiles on PolyRatings.dev

### Name Matching Algorithm

The extension uses sophisticated name matching to handle various formats:

- **Exact Match**: Direct string comparison
- **Format Conversion**: "First Last" ‚Üî "Last, First"
- **Multi-word Names**: Handles complex last names
- **Partial Matching**: Fallback for variations and middle names
